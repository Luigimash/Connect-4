# Connect 4
A video game I developed with the Unity Game Engine, scripted in C#. This was my first ever Unity game project, and I learned a lot in making this basic game. As a result, it is very unpolished and has a lot of problems. 

## How To Play
Download the ZIP for the repository by clicking Code -> Download as ZIP. Then, unzip the file and run `Connect 4.exe`.
